Minutes of Meeting (Feb 24, 2021):
Status Update:
1. Fixstars has started the experiments on MIT DGX1 and OpenMind. 
2. Experiments 500-515 and 532-547 were completed. Experiments 516-531 is currently ongoing on DGX1 and 548-563 on OpenMind.
3. We observed that nodes "node023, node026, node004, node003.cm.cluster" have problems with GPU version and pytorch incompatibility.
4. Fixstars tested the pre-built version of Pytorch docker and observed that both built and conda versions perform similar, and there is no performance boost with building the Pytorch library.
5. Fixstars performed resource analysis of all experiments in case 1 and found that peak usage are: Main memory: 8GB and GPU memory of 6GB. We can thus run at least 2 experiments at a time on each GPU.

Resource Update:
1. Xavier investigates if OpenMind or Satori nodes can be used for computations. Each node in Satori has 4 32GB V100 GPUs and we may get a better deal that AWS.
2. Fixstars clarifies that if MIT is able to provide quotation and accept purchase order and check to the same entity, then it might work.
3. AWS is kept as an backup option for now. We will wait to start computations on it till next meeting.
