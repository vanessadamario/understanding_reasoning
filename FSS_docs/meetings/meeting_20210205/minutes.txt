Minutes of Meeting (Feb 05, 2021 Friday):
Purpose: 
We discuss on the task lists for smoother result generation and on adjusting the experiments based on the experiment results.
AWS notes:
1. The computation AWS will be available from 2/15 to 3/26.
2. We have received two AWS instances from Fujitsu Lab. We are performing some connection testing to see if ray can be established here. There might be some firewall settings that may need to be modified.
3. Fixstars will execute the validation on AWS itself.
4. MIT researchers ask to get the cost of running the experiments. Fixstars will evaluate the cost based on the number of experiments and overall cost.
Plan:
1. Fixstars plans to analyse the train.json to estimate the approximate resource requirement for each experiment.
2. Script creation will happen starting from 2/8.
3. MIT researcher plan to add more datasets on the fly.
4. The execution for a single experiment involves 4 steps: train, update, test and updating the visualization jupyter notebook. 
5. The output of a single experiment are 4 files: model, model.json, model.best, notebook (notebook is common for all experiments of a case).
6. Fixstars will evaluate if a email based notification system can be had (a very basic SMTP based code) to notify experiment completion.
Todo:
1. Xavier and Vanessa will share the data. They are sharing the same at: /om5/user/vanessad/shared_understanding_reasoning/. We see 75GB for case 1 and 340 GB for case 3. Data for cases 2, 4 is still pending.
2. Xavier and Vanessa will also provide the train.json for each case.
3. They also provide a list of priority experiments to be run in first go.
4. Based on discussion over slack, Fixstars will modify the code for running on AWS.
